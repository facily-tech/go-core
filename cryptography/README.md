# Cryptography

Cryptography is a symmetric key cryptography library. This type of encryption uses the same key to encrypt and also to decrypt messages.

To create a new encryption it is necessary to pass the key and the unique number (nonce) as a parameter.

**key required 16 digits,**

**nonce required 12 digits**.
